to run this application you must have postgresql setup on the machine also running the calendar application.
To download postgresql follow this link https://www.postgresql.org/download/
    1)download your OS version of postgresql
    2)install postgresql onto your machine
    3)create admin user for postgresql  - make sure to remember your password for this admin as you will need it later
    4)open up pgadmin and login to your server, create a DB by right clicking "Databases" creating a new one
    5)in the db.py file update the password with whatever you created along with updaing the db_name to be whatever you creted

I'd recommend downloading pycharm community edition for editing and running the software
To download pycharm follow this link https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows  (this is a windows link)
    1)download the community edition
    2)install pycharm onto your machine
    3)open the calendar application using pycharm
    4) open the pycharm settings through "file"->"settings" and open the "Project: calendar"
    5) within the "python interpreter" install "SQLAlchemy"


If you have pycharm download, with the application open through pycharm, downloaded SQLalchemy, then you can click
the little green arrow (play button looking icon) in the top rightish of the window and the application will run.
